# C# 7 Kata

A kata that helps you practice and discover the [new language features of C# 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/csharp-7)

**Kata** originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approach, rather than as individuals in a disorderly manner. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata)

### Definition

In this Kata we will learn how to use new features from C# 7 such as `out variables`, `ValueTuples`, `Pattern Matching`, `ref locals and returns`, `Local Functions`, `expression-bodied members`, `throw Expressions`, `Generalized async return types`, and `Numeric literal syntax improvements`.  Make sure to visit the links below for some really great content that will help you navigate these katas.
